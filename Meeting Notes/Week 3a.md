## Sprint Retrospective - Week 2

| Task                        | What went well?                                                                                                         | Would've been even better if?                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acceptance Requirements     | Quite straightforward; had prior experience completing one Had functional requirements already available to base it off | Some requirements were not clear, had to ammend acceptance criteria                                                                                        |
| Expanding Learning Outcomes | Easy to do; was already built out so just needed expansion.                                                             | Due to constraints, the LO we could produce are limited                                                                                                    |
| Finding Unity Assets        | Most assets were relatively easy to find, using the Unity Store                                                         | Most were paid so difficult to find a free version that was suitable                                                                                       |
| Personality Questionaire    | Easy to fill; Gave succinct overview of everyone's best roles, and potential area's to contribute to the team           | Some missing roles, which had to be delegated                                                                                                              |
| Translations                | Native speakers were translating the words, ensuring accuracy                                                           | They knew all the words, but had to translate with support of Google                                                                                       |
| MVP                         | Researched another language game MVP, and used it as basis to create a succinct and relevant MVP for this game          | It was sightly more difficult to estimate possible level of game in a few short weeks, would've been better if there was further time to develop the game. |
| UML                         | Experience in flowcharts so simple to understand and design                                                             | Better if spoken to potential users before creating the UML diagrams                                                                                       |
