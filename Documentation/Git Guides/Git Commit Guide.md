## Git commit commands

basic commit `git commit`
- will open an editor to write out the commit title and body

`git commit -m "Title" -m "body"`
- replace title here with the title for the commit and same for body

for the title and body, follow the below formats 

## Git commit Format
 
The **Title** should be capitalised with **50 characters or less summary**

It should specify the type of commit
- **feat** = adding a new feature to application
- **fix** = a bug fix
- **docs** = anything relating to documentation
- **test** = anything relating to tests
- **chore** = regular code maintenance, some small/other task

In text editor separate the subject title from the body with a single line

Use **imperative** method for title
- e.g. Use "Fix" instead of "Fixed"

The **body** is primarily used to explain the changes made and **why** you made them
- can be optional on small commits like chores
