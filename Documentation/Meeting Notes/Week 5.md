## Sprint Retrospective - Week 5

| **Task**                               | **What went well?**                                                                                                                                                      | **Would've been even better if?**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Time (actual vs expected)** |

| Database Initialisation and Testing                          | MonogDB worked and the database was successfully made and works properly                                                                                                                                                           | MongoDB turned out to not be the best option for Unity2D since it wasn't directly supported. If we had done more research on databases we could've found one with more options                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 2 hr  v 2 hr                         |
| ReadMe Markdown                                | Everything went well in the Markdown and it took about as long as expected                                                                                                                                                            | Not sure about where to put the file itself, clarity would've been good before starting on it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 1hr v 1 hr                        |
| Quit Button on Start Screen                            | I found a good tutorial to explain why it wasn't working in the build and it was an easy fix                                                                                                    | If it was done as a paired programming task that would've been best rather than solo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 15mins vs 1 hr                |
| Code Refactoring                       | Wasn't much to cleanup and nothing seemed to break from it. Documentation was easy for it                                                                                | If we found better solutions to refactor the code since some is duplicated, if we had more time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 3 hrs vs 4 hrs                     |
| Test Refactoring                       | Cleanup was rather quick since the people that coded it were always together for paired programming                                                                                             | There are some repetitions in the code still, would be fixed with more time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 1 hr vs 1 hr                        |
| Implement Leaderboard Screen           | I found an easier solution than using jsons which was the csv file approach. It was easy to read and write from it.                                                      | My code is a bit messy in displaying it so sorting the array is a little messy. If we had more time I could refactor it to make it better.                                                                                                                                                                                     | 4 hrs vs 5 hrs                       |
| Tutorial Popup                         | I found a good resource that showed how to do something like that, so that was good.                                                                                     | I should've designed it a bit better or made it as a task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 2 hrs vs 2 hrs                 |
| Randomised Words on Planets            | We did finish it, so that was good. I think the good thing about it was that even though we had different ideas at some parts we were able to agree on it all in the end | One of the most difficult tasks we did coding wise. It was expected that it would be this hard though. The way that the display can get messed up with the canvas and words showing up in random places, but it was fixed in the end. If there was a better approach I would've done that instead. Could use more refactoring. | 6 hours vs 4 hours                 |
| Test for Spaceship exiting camera view | Did not take very long since the code used before was viable for this test as well                                                                                       | Some changes needed to be made afterwards due to later iterations breaking the code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 1 hr v 1 hr                        |
| Choice of Language in Menu             | It was about as much work as we expected, and we found a good resource to show how it's done.                                                                            | It was a bit annoying to pass the data to the rest of the scenes. Refactoring of the language choice could've been done better. We had to duplicate a lot of code. If there was a more programmatic way that would be good, but we didnt' find it.                                                                             | 2 hrs vs 2 hrs                      |
| Amend Menu Screen                      | Everything went well. First time it was difficult, but later on when we did it it was easier.                                                                            | We underestimated the task and it took a bit longer than expected. May have been better as a paired programming task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 1 hr 30 mins vs 30mins      |
| 500 word reflection                    | Everyone worked together to contribute to the sections most relevant to us. Afterwards it was combined into one singular document of 500 words in length                 | There was a lot to look back on and it took a bit longer than expected                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 2 hr vs 1 hr                 |
| Consistent Screen Size                 | Annoying to figure out, a lot of trial and error, and a lot of googling on finding the solution                                                                          | If the screen sizes didn't change cause of operating systems, that would be great                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 1 hr vs 1 hr                        |
| Finish making all Tests                       | Writing was easy, just tedious. If this wasn't paired programming some of the writers weren't able to do it. Because people who knew programming were there they were able to teach us     | Some tests didn't pass cause of Unity2D quirks, and fixing them took some testing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 2 hrs vs 2 hrs                       |
| Planet Explosion                       | Relatively easy to code due to paired programming                                                                                                             | I think the hardest thing for planet explosion was finding another unity asset for it and having it attached to the sprite                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 1 hr vs 1 hr                       |
| Sound on Hit Fix                       | The fix was easily found because it was related to the game logic and how the game progressed.                                                                           | If the flow of the game was decided on earlier, a different solution could've been made to build it for the original way the game was designed                                                                                                                                                                                 | 1 hr 1 hr                 |
| Fix: Duplicate Audio Listener          | While this error didn't create any problems, it would constantly show up.                                                                                                | Not knowing what parts of the code were set to DoNotUnload made it difficult to determine where the error was coming from. If we were involved in all the code, then the problem would've been more apparent earlier                                                                                                           | 4 hrs vs 1 hr             |
| Alternative for Java Docs              | Found ane asy solution to this, basically just the C# standard                                                                                                           | If we could've find something more like a java doc like a XML document. But C# seems to make it difficult for that                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 30mins vs 1 hr              |

| Fix: Make Username save in Built Game too                           | It was definitely an unexpected problem to happen right at the end, but thankfully we were able to get it done right before the deadlines                                                                                                                       | If this had happened earlier in the build progress than there would be a lot less panic about it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2 hr vs 2 hr                       |
