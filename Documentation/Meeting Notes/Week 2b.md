| The user will learn basic english words related to conversation and daily use.                                                                                      | Many individuals seek tools that aid in language acquisition of basic english.                                                                      | The words are learned by word association through a selection game where the user is given a word in their native language and then must choose the correct corresponding english word.                                                                                                                                                              |
| The user will refine their comprehension skills by accurately selecting the most appropriate english word corresponding to the given word in their native language. | This reinforces their understanding of language and improves their ability to interpret and respond effectively in communication contexts.          | This is achieved through iterative gameplay sessions where users encounter various word pairs to increase vocabulary retention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Overall this facilitates long-term retention of vocabulary. A feedback mechanic where the definition of an incorrect and correct choice may be given to provide users with immediate guidance and feedback as well. |
