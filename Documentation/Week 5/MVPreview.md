S = success
P = partial success, achieved some of this kevel or implemented differently 
F = failed to achieve level

Take away: although we achieved the vast majority of these tasks, we didn't fully achieve 2 of them. This is due to the overestimation of tasks on this MVP. It should've been made smaller in hindsight as MVP for us meant just a working game by the end of this group coursework.
